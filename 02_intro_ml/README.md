# Phase 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what Machine Learning is
- Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Build your first ML model
- Understand train/test split and model evaluation

## Topics Covered
1. What is Machine Learning?
2. Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
3. Your First Model: Linear Regression
4. Classification Basics
5. Model Evaluation Metrics

## Projects
1. **House Price Prediction** - Predict house prices using linear regression
2. **Iris Classification** - Classify iris flowers into species

## Key Concepts
- **Features**: Input variables (X)
- **Labels/Targets**: What we want to predict (y)
- **Training**: Teaching the model with data
- **Testing**: Checking if the model works on new data
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data but fails on new data (too complex, high variance)
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in both training and test data (too simple, high bias)
