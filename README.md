## Prerequisites

Before diving into Machine Learning, you should have a basic understanding of:

### Essential Skills:
- **Python Programming**: Basic syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), functions, loops
- **Mathematics**: 
  - Basic algebra
  - Basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
  - Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices) - can learn as you go
- **Data Handling**: Working with CSV files, basic data manipulation

### Don't Worry If:
- You're not a math expert (we'll learn as we go!)
- You're new to programming (Python is beginner-friendly)
- You've never done ML before (that's why we're here!)
